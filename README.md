## Stakeholders

To better understand the needs and concerns of our stakeholders, we interviewed Jonathan Mak, a sophomore at NYU. We believed that he was a good representative of our target end-users as he frequently studies at multiple locations at NYU, and has expressed frustration in the past at not being able to find study areas with available spots.  

## Product Vision Statement

We aim to empower NYU students with real-time insights into campus study areas, ensuring a productive and hassle-free study experience by intuitively connecting them with study areas with available spaces.

## User Requirements

- As a student, I want to be able to tell if a study area has available spots, so I can know which study areas to go to
- As a student, I want to be able to search for a specific study area so that I can check the status of any study area
- As a student, I want to be able to easily see whether my favorite study areas have available spots, so I can know if I should go to them
- As a student, I want to be able to update the status of study areas on campus, so I can let other users know the statuses of study areas on campus
- As a student, I want to be recommended study areas on campus that were recently updated to be empty so that I know with more certainty that theyâ€™ll be available when I get there
- As a student, I want to be able to assign different statuses to study locations, so I can differentiate between study areas that are empty, almost full, or completely full
- As a student, I want to be notified when my favorite study areas have spots open up, so I can know when I should try going there
- As a student, I want to be able to create an account, so I can save my favorite spots and other information
- As a student, I want to be able to quickly see my account details, so I can see which of my personal information is stored by the application
- As a student, I want to be able to modify my account details, so I can update any in case there is a need for it
- As a student, I want to be able to contact the developers, so I can let them know about any problem with the app
